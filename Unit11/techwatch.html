            <h2>Name of tablet</h2>
            <p>Paragraph of tablet that will take up sufficient space that we can get a good idea of about how much it
                will
                block up. Really, since design should begin content out so you can get a good scope of what kind of
                information would be first, use of lorem ipsum and other filler text usually isn't the best idea. You
                want
                to know what to build the site around, and invariably, some of the filler text gets left behind when the
                site goes live. And that is always embarrising.</p>
