        <h1>About this Site</h1>

        <p>ROMhacking.net is the innovative new community site that aggressively aims to bring several different areas
            of the community together. First, it serves as a successor to, and merges content from, ROMhacking.com and
            The Whirlpool. Besides being a simple archive site, ROMhacking.net's purpose is to bring the ROMhacking
            Community to the next level. We want to put the word 'community' back into the ROMhacking community.</p>
        <p>The ROMhacking community in recent years has been scattered and stagnant. It is our goal and hope to bring
            people back together and breathe some new life into the community. We want to encourage new people to join
            the hobby and make it easier than ever for them to do so.</p>
        <p>It is also our goal to fill the roll of a one stop news source for the community. We strive to overcome the
            problems and succeed where other similar sites have failed. One unique way we hope to do that is through
            putting the power in your hands.</p>
        <p>We hope to allow the community members to submit their own work, maintain the database, and make the news
            updates themselves. Our long term goal is to have a community run site that does not rely on the bottleneck
            of staff to do everything, which can often lead to a stale and inactive site. The full system for this
            transition will take time, but it has already begun. This is a site built for the community and it will
            endure ongoing changes based on your feedback to provide the services you need.</p>

<h2>ROMhacking.net Site Goals and Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a central hub to encourage a new, refreshed, ROMhacking community.</li>
<li>Eliminate problems other sites have had that cause stagnation or site 'death'.</li>
<li>Provide a comprehensive document, utility, and translation archive.</li>
<li>Expand that archive to include whatever the community necessitates.</li>
<li>Put the power into the community member's hands for site operation and maintenance.</li>
<li>Provide an active, central, one stop news source for the community.</li>
<li>Provide a community database to tell you who is out there, who is active, and what they're doing!</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the goals and features that you will find here on this site.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>So, you want to be a ROMhacker? If you're reading this, you're probably overwhelmed at the large number of utilities and documents available on this site. What should you be looking for? What do you need? Where do you start? This section will try and help clarify these things for you.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're going to try and do translations, graphical hacks, or level hacks, you really need the same fundamental knowledge for any kind of ROMhacking. We have taken the time to label all the documents and utilities in our database that we feel are helpful for beginners just like you. However, sometimes these beginner documents still don't quite start at the beginning. That's what we're going to do here.</p>
<p>We're going to show you around and point you to what you need to know to start helping yourself with all our beginner level documents on your own! After all, ROMhacking is very much a self taught hobby. Here is an outline of what we'll be seeing on our tour:</p>
