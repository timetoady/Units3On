                <p>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years
                    studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
                    merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for
                    the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend
                    towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any
                    which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey
                    family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.

                <p>The events in question occurred in the early days of my
                    association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible
                    that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time,
                    from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom
                    the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have
                    reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend
                    to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.

                <p>It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully
                    dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece
                    showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps
                    just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits."Very sorry to knock you up,
                    Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has
                    been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."

                    "What is it, then--a fire?"</p>

                <p>"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who
                    insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about
                    the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume
                    that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an
                    interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate,
                    that I should call you and give you the chance."</p>
